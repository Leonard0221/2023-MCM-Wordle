# Cracking the Past for Future: Comprehensive Analysis of Wordle Players’ Participation and Performance via Time Series, ML, and NLP

## Summary

The New York Times introduced a web-based word game called Wordle in 2022. The game is to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer. However, the data from January 7, 2022, to December 31, 2022, shows that the number of reported players continued to decline after a short-term increase. Therefore, through historical data analysis, this report discovered some potential patterns for the game to enjoy long-term prosperity.

We first performed data cleaning and adjustments followed by analyzing the relation of attributes and times. We conduct time series analysis and natural language processing methods to retrieve 82 time-series features and 47 word-related features. The goal of our model is to find out the number of reported results’ trend with time, the relationship between the word attribute and the distribution of tries, and predict the distribution guessed at a given day. Specifically, the study includes the following parts.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Description: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data is ready for analysis.

2. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Description: Analyze time-series features to understand the trend of reported results over time.

3. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Description: Extract word-related features using natural language processing techniques.

4. **Prediction of Reported Results**
   - Description: Use GluonTS and ARIMA to predict the number of reported results on March 1st and compare the models.

5. **Word Attribute and Tries Distribution**
   - Description: Analyze the relationship between word attributes and the distribution of tries. Use machine learning algorithms to predict difficulty levels.

## Suggestions to the New York Times

Based on our analysis, we have prepared a letter of suggestions to the New York Times for future game development. Our suggestions include introducing new features to the game and making the game more consistent, inclusive, comprehensive, and attractive.
